# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in *Feel the Stars*.

This repository is intentionally shared as a **concept and handoff**, not as an actively maintained project.

## What this project is
- A documented idea for an accessibility-focused mobile app
- A starting point for discussion, experimentation, or independent development
- An open invitation for others to take the idea forward

## Ways to contribute
You are welcome to:
- Share feedback or concerns (especially from blind or visually impaired users)
- Suggest improvements to the interaction or accessibility approach
- Prototype or experiment with your own implementation
- Fork the repository and build independently
- Take ownership of the idea as part of a team, organisation, or study project

## No permission required
You do **not** need approval to:
- fork this repository
- adapt the idea
- reimplement it elsewhere
- take the concept further without ongoing involvement from the original author

If the idea evolves beyond this repository, that is considered a success.

## How to engage
- Open an issue if you want to discuss the idea or share feedback
- Fork the repo if you want to build or experiment
- Feel free to credit the origin, but it is not required

Accessibility, respect, and good faith collaboration are the only expectations.
